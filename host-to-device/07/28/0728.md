### *`07 28 0C 0N 0F`* - Submit keyboard colour change - 24 bit colour

Must be preceded by a stream of [`7f` packets](https://github.com/mattanger/ckb-next/wiki/Corsair-Protocol#7f-nn-ss-00---write-multiple-packet-stream), in the sequence of:

`C` is the colour type, `N` is the number of packets (not bytes!) for this colour, `F` is a finish marker - `1` if not finished, `2` if finished.

- Red values per key (one byte of colour) in 3 `7f` packets.
- `07 28 01 03 01` - `C` for red is `1`, `0N` is number of packets for this colour - `3`, `0F` is `1` - packets are not finished.
- Green values per key (one byte of colour) in 3 `7f` packets.
- `07 28 02 03 01` - `C` for green is `2`, `0N` is number of packets for this colour - `3`, `0F` is `1` - packets are not finished.
- Blue values per key (one byte of colour) in 3 `7f` packets.
- `07 28 03 03 02` - `C` for blue is `3`, `0N` is number of packets for this colour - `3`, `0F` is `2` - packet stream is finished.
