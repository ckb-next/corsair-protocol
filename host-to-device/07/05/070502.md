### *`07 05 02 00 0X`* - Switch to software lighting control

**This should be your second packet.**

The ckb code says this is meant to enable software lighting control, like when the device is used by CUE. However, it just turns off all the lights.

`X` needs to be `3` on keyboards. For mice, `X` needs to be `1` to enable lighting, and `0` to disable it.
