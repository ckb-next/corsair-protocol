### *`07 27 00 00 NN`* - Submit keyboard colour change - 9 bit colour

Must be preceded by a stream of [`7f` packets](https://github.com/mattanger/ckb-next/wiki/Corsair-Protocol#7f-nn-ss-00---write-multiple-packet-stream), in the sequence of red values per key (one byte, least significant three bits of colour), followed by green (same format), followed by blue (same format). The bytes must be contiguous - the green bytes must start at the end of the red bytes, even if this is in the middle of a packet.

`NN` indicates the number of bytes in the `7f` packet stream payloads (60 byte payload per packet) - must be a multiple of 3 (for red, green and blue).
