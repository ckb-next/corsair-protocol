# `0e 13 03 01` - Mouse lift height

(`0e 13 03 00` also seems to be accepted?)

There are 5 lift height settings, with lowest at 1 and highest at 5.

Note that the lift height may be out of range from these values - this
should be accepted, but assumed to be low.

Example response:
```
0e [Read command]
13 [Mouse]
03 [Lift height]
01 [??? - the mouse accepts 0 and 1, but doesn't reply to anything outside of that]
02 [Medium lift height]
```
