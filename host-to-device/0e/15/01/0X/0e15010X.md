# `0e 15 01 0X` - Query Xth mode ID

This returns a 16-byte GUID, plus a 4-byte "modified" flag for the Xth mode. With the exception of the K95, most keyboards and mice have only one mode.

Example response:

```
0e [Read command]
15 [Mode ID]
01 [??? - required to be 1]
01 [Query 1st mode ID]
<16 byte little endian GUID, omitted for brevity>
<4 byte little endian modified flag, omitted for brevity>
```
