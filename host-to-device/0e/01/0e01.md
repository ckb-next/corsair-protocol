# `0e 01` - Firmware identification

ckb-next only parses from the first 16 bytes. This packet seems to have two forms, which diverge at the 21st byte according to whether the device is a keyboard or mouse.

Example response (common):
```
0e [Read command]
01 [Firmware information]
00 [Invalid bytes here from the host are accepted and ignored]
00 [Invalid bytes here from the host are accepted and ignored]
01 [??? - Possibly 16.8M colour support?]
01 [???]
00 [???]
01 [???]
06 [Firmware version low byte]
02 [Firmware version high byte - firmware is 2.06]
04 [Bootloader version low byte]
00 [Bootloader version high byte - bootloader is v4]
1c [Corsair USB Vendor ID low byte]
1b [Corsair USB Vendor ID high byte - Corsair's USB vendor ID is 1b1c]
2e [Corsair USB Product ID low byte]
1b [Corsair USB Product ID high byte - 1b2e is the M65 Pro RGB Mouse]
01 [Poll rate in milliseconds]

```

Continuation from a keyboard:
```
c0 [??? - keyboard identification byte?]
ff [???]
40 [???]
00 [??? - keyboard physical layout identifier?
    00 is ANSI (America), 01 is ISO (Europe), 02 is ABNT (Brazil) and
    03 is JIS (Japan).]
03 [???]
00 [???]
00 [???]
00 [???]
02 [??? - varies between keyboards]
04 [??? - varies between keyboards]
01 [??? - varies between keyboards]
02 [??? - keyboard virtual layout identifier?
    This depends on the physical layout, but we're gathering more info.]
